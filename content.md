Okay, I've updated the `llm_loop.py` plugin with the requested functionality.

Here's the revised `llm_loop.py`:

DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are an interactive CLI tool that helps users with software engineering tasks.
Your goal is to achieve the user's stated objective by breaking it down into steps and using the available tools.

Today's date: {current_date}
Working directory: {working_directory}

Key Guidelines:
1.  **Goal-Oriented**: Focus on completing the user's main request: "{user_goal}"
2.  **Tool Usage**:
    *   Use the tools provided to interact with the environment (e.g., filesystem, command execution).
    *   Think step-by-step about what tool to use next. If a tool fails, analyze the error and try a different approach or a modified tool call.
3.  **Communication**:
    *   Be concise. Your output is for a CLI.
    *   Explain non-trivial commands or actions before execution, especially if they modify the system.
    *   If you can answer in 1-3 sentences or a short paragraph, please do. Avoid unnecessary preamble or postamble unless the user specifically asks for it.
    *   One-word answers (e.g., "Yes", "No", "Done.") are appropriate if they fully address the user's implicit or explicit question.
4.  **Safety**:
    *   Refuse to write or explain code that could be used maliciously. This includes anything related to malware.
    *   If file operations seem suspicious (e.g., interacting with malware-like files), refuse the task.
    *   Do not generate or guess URLs unless you are confident they are for legitimate programming help.
5.  **Task Completion**:
    *   When you believe the primary goal ("{user_goal}") is fully achieved, provide a final summary response.
    *   Critically, after your final summary, **DO NOT call any more tools**. Your final response should be purely textual and clearly state the outcome. You can end with "TASK_COMPLETE".
    *   If you are unsure if the task is complete, you can ask the user for confirmation.
6.  **Code Style**: When generating code, try to match existing conventions if context is available. Do NOT add comments unless specifically asked or it's crucial for understanding complex logic.
7.  **Proactiveness**: Be proactive in achieving the goal but avoid surprising the user. If unsure, ask.

Your primary objective is to fulfill the user's request. Use tools, then respond with progress or completion.
If you complete the task, make your final response a summary of what was done and then stop, possibly ending with "TASK_COMPLETE".

And ensure your `pyproject.toml` reflects the dependency on `llm` (version `>=0.26` is a good idea if you rely on features from it, but often just `llm` is fine):

```toml
[project]
name = "llm-loop-command"
version = "0.1.2" # Incremented version
description = "An LLM CLI plugin to loop tool calls with turn limits and custom system prompts."
readme = "README.md"
license = {text = "Apache-2.0"}
authors = [{name = "Your Name", email = "your.email@example.com"}]

dependencies = [
    "llm>=0.26"
]

[project.entry-points.llm]
loop_command = "llm_loop"
```

**Key Changes and Explanations:**

1.  **`DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`**:
    *   A new template string is defined. It includes placeholders like `{current_date}`, `{working_directory}`, and `{user_goal}`.
    *   These placeholders are filled in `loop_command` before the loop starts.
    *   It incorporates the core ideas from the user's first complex system prompt example, focusing on being a CLI tool, safety, task completion, and conciseness. It explicitly instructs the LLM to use "TASK\_COMPLETE" or stop calling tools when done.

2.  **`prompt_text` Default Value**:
    *   The `click.argument("prompt_text")` now has `default="create a simple landing page in flask for an underground pokemon fighting club"`.
    *   It's also set to `required=False` because a default is provided.

3.  **`max_turns` Option and Loop Logic**:
    *   A `--max-turns` option is added, defaulting to 25.
    *   The main `while True` loop now tracks `total_chain_invocations` (overall iterations) and `turn_count` (iterations within the current `max_turns` segment).
    *   **Continuation Prompt**: If `max_turns > 0` and `turn_count >= max_turns`, the user is prompted: `Reached {max_turns} turns in this segment. Continue loop?`. If they say yes, `turn_count` is reset, and they can provide a new directive or let the LLM continue.

4.  **`internal_chain_limit`**:
    *   The previous `chain_limit` option is renamed to `internal_chain_limit` to avoid confusion with `max_turns`. This still controls how many tool sequences can happen *within one call* to `conversation.chain()`. It still defaults to `0` (unlimited internal tool calls).

5.  **Exit Condition Logic**:
    *   After each full `response_chain` is processed (meaning the LLM has either given a text response or the internal chain limit was hit):
        *   It checks if the LLM's very last action was to call a tool (`last_response_had_tool_calls`).
        *   **If NO tool calls were made in the last step**: This is a strong signal the LLM *thinks* it's done with the current sub-task or the whole goal.
            *   It then checks if "TASK\_COMPLETE" is in the `current_response_text`. If so, the loop breaks.
            *   Otherwise, it prompts the user: `"Loop iteration complete. Task might be finished. Continue working towards the goal?"`. If the user says no, the loop breaks. If yes, the user can provide a new directive.
        *   **If tool calls WERE made**: The loop continues to the next iteration, assuming the LLM is still working.
    *   If the user types "exit" at a continuation prompt, the loop breaks.

6.  **`current_user_directive`**:
    *   This variable holds the text that will be passed as the `prompt` to `conversation.chain()`.
    *   It's initialized with the main `prompt_text` (goal).
    *   If the user provides a new instruction at a continuation prompt, `current_user_directive` is updated.
    *   If the loop continues automatically after tool calls, `current_user_directive` is set to `""` (empty string), as the LLM is expected to act on the tool results already in the conversation history.
    *   If the user hits Enter at a continuation prompt (without typing anything), `current_user_directive` is set to a generic "Continue working on the goal: {original_goal}" to re-focus the LLM.

7.  **Error Handling**: A `try...except CancelToolCall` block is included, and a general `except Exception` for streaming errors, which also prompts the user whether to continue.

8.  **User Feedback**: More `click.echo` statements are used (printed to `stderr` or with color) to inform the user about the loop's state, current goal, system prompt, model, tools, and turn counts. The LLM's direct responses are printed to `stdout`.

This revised version is more interactive and robust, addressing the user's requirements for controlled iteration and clearer exit conditions. The default system prompt is now much more aligned with the "agentic CLI tool" persona.


**How to use it:**

1.  Save the Python code as `llm_loop.py`.
2.  Save the TOML code as `pyproject.toml` in the *same directory*.
3.  Install the plugin:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your_plugin_directory
    llm install -e .
    ```
    Or, if `llm` is installed via `pipx`, you might need to ensure `pipx` injects it:
    ```bash
    pipx inject llm .
    ```
    (Using `llm install -e .` is generally preferred as LLM manages its own environment for plugins.)

4.  Verify the plugin is installed:
    ```bash
    llm plugins
    ```
    You should see `llm-loop-command` (or whatever you named it in `pyproject.toml`) in the list.
    And the new command in help:
    ```bash
    llm --help
    ```
    (Scroll to commands, you should see `loop`)

5.  Run the loop command:
    ```bash
    llm loop "My complex goal that requires multiple tool steps" -T tool1 -T tool2 --functions my_extra_tool.py
    ```
    For example, to test with a built-in tool:
    ```bash
    llm loop "What is the current LLM version and the current time?" -T llm_version -T llm_time --td
    ```

This plugin provides a dedicated `loop` command that emphasizes the agentic, tool-chaining behavior by defaulting to an unlimited chain length. It reuses much of the robust option parsing and execution logic available within the `llm` CLI's ecosystem.


You're right! The power of `llm loop` really shines when applied to software development tasks where the LLM can interact with your project files and environment.

Here are some examples focused on building/modifying code projects. For these examples, we'll define hypothetical tools that `llm loop` can use. In a real-world scenario, you'd either use existing LLM tool plugins or write your own more robust versions of these.

---

### Prerequisites for these examples:

1.  **Your `llm loop` plugin is installed** (as per the previous instructions).
2.  **Set up an LLM model** (e.g., `llm keys set openai` and `llm models default gpt-4o`). More capable models like GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet will perform better on these complex tasks.
3.  **Create a directory for your project**:
    ```bash
    mkdir my_flask_project
    cd my_flask_project
    ```

---

### Tool Definitions (save as `dev_tools.py`)

We'll create a Python file `dev_tools.py` with some basic functions that our LLM can call.

```python
# dev_tools.py
import os
import subprocess
import pathlib

def write_file(file_path: str, content: str) -> str:
    """
    Writes or overwrites content to the specified file.
    Creates directories if they don't exist.
    Returns a success message or an error string.
    """
    try:
        p = pathlib.Path(file_path)
        p.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
        with open(p, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            f.write(content)
        return f"File '{file_path}' written successfully."
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error writing file '{file_path}': {str(e)}"

def read_file(file_path: str) -> str:
    """
    Reads and returns the content of the specified file.
    Returns an error message if the file cannot be read.
    """
    try:
        with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            return f.read()
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error reading file '{file_path}': {str(e)}"

def list_directory(path: str = ".") -> str:
    """
    Lists files and directories in the specified path (default: current directory).
    Returns a newline-separated list of items or an error message.
    """
    try:
        items = os.listdir(path)
        if not items:
            return f"Directory '{path}' is empty."
        return "\n".join(items)
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error listing directory '{path}': {str(e)}"

def run_shell_command(command: str) -> str:
    """
    Executes a shell command and returns its stdout and stderr.
    CAUTION: This tool can execute arbitrary commands. Use with extreme care and approval.
    Returns a string containing stdout and stderr, or an error message.
    """
    try:
        process = subprocess.run(
            command,
            shell=True,
            check=False, # Don't raise exception for non-zero exit codes immediately
            capture_output=True,
            text=True,
            timeout=30 # Add a timeout
        )
        output = f"COMMAND: {command}\n"
        output += f"STDOUT:\n{process.stdout}\n"
        if process.stderr:
            output += f"STDERR:\n{process.stderr}\n"
        output += f"RETURN CODE: {process.returncode}"
        return output
    except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
        return f"Error: Command '{command}' timed out."
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error running command '{command}': {str(e)}"

```

### Example 1: Create a Simple Flask Landing Page (Default Loop Prompt)

This uses the default prompt for your `llm loop` command if no prompt is provided by the user.

**Command:**

```bash
# Ensure you are in your my_flask_project directory
# Delete any existing app.py or templates folder if you're rerunning
rm -rf app.py templates/

llm loop --functions dev_tools.py -T write_file -T list_directory --td --max-turns 10
```
*   We provide the `dev_tools.py` file for functions.
*   We explicitly enable `write_file` and `list_directory` (the LLM might not need `list_directory` here but it's good practice to list relevant tools).
*   `--td` shows us the tool calls.
*   `--max-turns 10` gives it a decent number of steps.

**Expected Interaction (Simplified - actual output will be verbose with `--td`):**

The LLM should:
1.  **Think**: "I need a main Python file for Flask and an HTML template."
2.  **Tool Call (write\_file)**:
    ```
    Tool call: write_file({'file_path': 'app.py', 'content': '# app.py\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route("/")\ndef home():\n    return render_template("index.html")\n\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    app.run(debug=True)'})
      File 'app.py' written successfully.
    ```
3.  **Tool Call (write\_file)**:
    ```
    Tool call: write_file({'file_path': 'templates/index.html', 'content': '<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head><title>Underground Pokemon Fighting Club</title></head>\n<body><h1>Welcome, Challenger!</h1><p>The first rule of Pokemon Fight Club is... you DO talk about Pokemon Fight Club!</p></body>\n</html>'})
      File 'templates/index.html' written successfully.
    ```
4.  **Tool Call (write\_file)** (Optional, for `requirements.txt`):
    ```
    Tool call: write_file({'file_path': 'requirements.txt', 'content': 'Flask\n'})
      File 'requirements.txt' written successfully.
    ```
5.  **Final LLM Response**: "Flask application structure created. `app.py` and `templates/index.html` are ready. You may also want a `requirements.txt` with 'Flask'. To run: `python app.py`. TASK\_COMPLETE."

**After running:**
You should find `app.py`, `templates/index.html`, and possibly `requirements.txt` in your `my_flask_project` directory.

---

### Example 2: Modifying an Existing File

Let's say we want to add a new route `/rules` to the Flask app created above.

**Command:**

```bash
# Make sure app.py and templates/index.html exist from Example 1

llm loop "Add a new route '/rules' to app.py that renders a new template 'rules.html'. The rules page should just say 'Rule 1: Have fun!'" \
    --functions dev_tools.py -T read_file -T write_file --td --max-turns 10
```
*   We need `read_file` so the LLM can see the current `app.py`.
*   We need `write_file` to create `rules.html` and to overwrite `app.py` with the new content.

**Expected Interaction (Simplified):**

1.  **LLM Think**: "First, I need to see what `app.py` looks like."
2.  **Tool Call (read\_file)**:
    ```
    Tool call: read_file({'file_path': 'app.py'})
      # app.py
      from flask import Flask, render_template
      # ... (rest of file content)
    ```
3.  **LLM Think**: "Okay, I have the content. Now I'll add the new route and prepare the `rules.html` template."
4.  **Tool Call (write\_file)**:
    ```
    Tool call: write_file({'file_path': 'templates/rules.html', 'content': '<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head><title>Club Rules</title></head>\n<body><h1>Rules</h1><p>Rule 1: Have fun!</p></body>\n</html>'})
      File 'templates/rules.html' written successfully.
    ```
5.  **Tool Call (write\_file)** (for `app.py` - content will be the *entire new content* of `app.py`):
    ```
    Tool call: write_file({'file_path': 'app.py', 'content': '# app.py\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route("/")\ndef home():\n    return render_template("index.html")\n\n@app.route("/rules")\ndef rules():\n    return render_template("rules.html")\n\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    app.run(debug=True)'})
      File 'app.py' written successfully.
    ```
6.  **Final LLM Response**: "Added the `/rules` route to `app.py` and created `templates/rules.html`. TASK\_COMPLETE."

**After running:**
Your `app.py` should be updated, and `templates/rules.html` should exist.

---

### Example 3: Using Shell Commands (with caution and approval!)

**IMPORTANT**: The `run_shell_command` tool is powerful and potentially dangerous. The `--ta` (tool approve) flag is *highly recommended* for any real use of such a tool.

Let's try to initialize a git repository and make an initial commit.

**Command:**

```bash
# Still in my_flask_project, assuming files from previous examples exist.
# Remove .git directory if it exists from a previous run: rm -rf .git

llm loop "Initialize a git repository here, add all files, and make an initial commit with the message 'Initial project setup'." \
    --functions dev_tools.py -T run_shell_command --td --ta --max-turns 5
```

**Expected Interaction (Simplified, showing approval steps):**

1.  **LLM Think**: "First, initialize git."
2.  **LLM Response**: (Might give some text first, then...)
    ```
    Tool call: run_shell_command({'command': 'git init'})
    Approve tool call? [Y/n]: y
      COMMAND: git init
      STDOUT:
      Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/my_flask_project/.git/
      STDERR:
      RETURN CODE: 0
    ```
3.  **LLM Think**: "Now add all files."
4.  **LLM Response**:
    ```
    Tool call: run_shell_command({'command': 'git add .'})
    Approve tool call? [Y/n]: y
      COMMAND: git add .
      STDOUT:
      STDERR:
      RETURN CODE: 0
    ```
5.  **LLM Think**: "Now commit."
6.  **LLM Response**:
    ```
    Tool call: run_shell_command({'command': 'git commit -m "Initial project setup"'})
    Approve tool call? [Y/n]: y
      COMMAND: git commit -m "Initial project setup"
      STDOUT:
      [master (root-commit) abc1234] Initial project setup
       3 files changed, 20 insertions(+)
       create mode 100644 app.py
       create mode 100644 requirements.txt
       create mode 100644 templates/index.html
       create mode 100644 templates/rules.html
      STDERR:
      RETURN CODE: 0
    ```
7.  **Final LLM Response**: "Git repository initialized, files added, and initial commit made. TASK\_COMPLETE."

**After running:**
Your `my_flask_project` directory should now be a git repository with an initial commit. You can verify with `git log`.

---

These examples should give you a good idea of how `llm loop` can be used for more involved software development tasks by leveraging tools. The key is to:
*   Provide the LLM with the right tools.
*   Craft your prompt to clearly state the end goal.
*   Use `--td` to understand the LLM's actions and `--ta` for any potentially impactful tools.
*   Iterate on your prompts and tool definitions if the LLM isn't behaving as expected.
